# Customer Segmentation Using Advanced Clustering Techniques

This project implements various clustering algorithms to segment customers based on features in the dataset. It provides insights into customer behavior and helps businesses make data-driven decisions. 

## Overview

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points with similar characteristics. This project demonstrates the application of clustering methods, including K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering, on a customer dataset to identify meaningful customer segments.

### Key Objectives:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer characteristics.
- Apply clustering techniques to segment customers based on their behavior.
- Visualize and compare clustering results.

## Features

- **Clustering Techniques**:
  - **K-Means Clustering**:
    - Applied to different feature combinations (e.g., Age & Spending Score, Income & Spending Score).
    - Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
  - **DBSCAN**:
    - Density-based clustering to identify noise and core samples.
    - Results visualized with scatter plots.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**:
    - Used dendrograms to represent the hierarchy of clusters.
    - Applied Ward's method for linkage.

- **Affinity Propagation**:
  - Automatic determination of the number of clusters.
  - Evaluated using silhouette scores.
